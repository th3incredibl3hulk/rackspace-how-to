With the Rackspace Migration Manager, Rackspace provides an easy self-service migration tool. In this initial phase, the Rackspace Migration Manager is
built specifically for customer migrations from the Rackspace Public Cloud to
Fanatical Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The Rackspace Migration Manager is intuitive and easy to navigate, and provides a quick and secure migration between Rackspace and Fanatical Support for AWS. With a little planning on your part, the Rackspace Migration Manager steps you easily through the migration process.

The migration process leverages both Rackspace and AWS APIs to securely move
resources. The customer's existing resources are not impacted during the migration.

Using the Rackspace Migration Manager, simply select the resources that you
want to migrate from the Rackspace Public Cloud to Fanatical Support for AWS.
We will provide you with our recommended Fanatical Support for AWS environment
setup, but you are free to customize configurations as well. Along the way,
the Rackspace Migration Manager keeps you informed of the current pricing of
your selected resources and what you can expect for pricing after you have migrated to Fanatical Support for AWS. Finally, simply schedule the best time for your migration to take place, and track progress as resources begin migrating from the migration dashboard within the manager tool.


### Professional Services

If you want help with the migration, Rackspace Professional Services are
available to handle the migration by providing an end-to-end service that
includes discovery, planning, testing, data, and configuration migration for
you.
