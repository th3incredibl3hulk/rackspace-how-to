With the Rackspace Migration Manager, Rackspace provides an easy self-service migration tool. In this initial phase, the Rackspace Migration Manager is
built specifically for customer migrations from the Rackspace Public Cloud to
Fanatical Support for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The Rackspace Migration Manager is intuitive and easy to navigate, and provides a quick and secure migration between Rackspace and Fanatical Support for AWS. With a little planning on your part, the Rackspace Migration Manager steps you easily through the migration process.

The migration process leverages both Rackspace and AWS APIs to securely move
resources. The customer's existing resources can be migrated offline, which minimizes corruption of the migrated data, or online with no downtime (but note that data can be corrupted if heavy writes occur during migration).

Using the Rackspace Migration Manager, simply select the resources that you
want to migrate from the Rackspace Public Cloud to Fanatical Support for AWS.
We will provide you with our recommended Fanatical Support for AWS environment
setup, but you are free to customize configurations as well. Along the way,
the Rackspace Migration Manager keeps you informed of the current pricing of
your selected resources and what you can expect for pricing after you have migrated to Fanatical Support for AWS. Finally, simply schedule the best time for your migration to take place, and track progress as resources begin migrating from the migration dashboard within the manager tool.

During the migration, you can see the status of your migration, percentage completion of the resources, and any resources that have errored during migration.  You can also cancel mid-flight migrations and re-initiate migrations if you'd like.  

Please note: while using this tool, you will be creating a second infrastructure within AWS for which you are billed. Once the migration is completed, you will need to confirm all data has moved completely and shut off your Rackspace Public Cloud resources to stop billing for them.

As always, you can reach out to your support team if you have any questions about how the tooling works or to resolve any problems you encounter of the migration tooling.
 

### Professional Services

If you want additional help with the migration, Rackspace Professional Services are
available to handle the migration by providing an end-to-end service that
includes discovery, planning, testing, data, and configuration migration for
you.
