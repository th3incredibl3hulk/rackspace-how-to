Get quick answers to common questions about migrating from Rackspace to Amazon
Web Services (AWS).

### General

#### Why are you helping customers move from your public cloud to AWS?

Rackspace provides expertise and support for the world's leading clouds,
including our OpenStack public cloud, AWS, and Microsoft Azure. Rackspace
gives customers a choice of the leading clouds and helps them find the best
fit for each of their workloads. Rackspace constantly seeks new ways to serve
customers, often starting with a beta program. At the moment, we're working on
a beta program to provide a smoother migration for our customers who are
interested in AWS infrastructure but want to continue to tap our expertise,
tooling, and support through our popular
[Fanatical Support&reg; for AWS service] (https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/managed-aws).

#### Will you eventually decommission your public cloud?

Rackspace has made no decision to decommission our public cloud. We continue
to invest in it. We are simply making it easier for customers who want to
migrate to AWS infrastructure to do so, while keeping the Rackspace expertise
and support that they value.

#### Is it true that your sales representatives are no longer available to new buyers of your public cloud?

No, that is not true. We continue to sell our OpenStack public cloud
through sales representatives and through our website.

### Beta migration from Rackspace to AWS

#### How can I participate in the beta migration program or learn more about it?

Like any beta program, this one is limited in the number of customers that it
can accommodate. If you want to participate in the beta program or learn
more about it, engage with your account manager, who will work with the
beta program leader to sign you up for the beta migration program.

#### What happens after the beta program? Are you considering a decommission of your public cloud then?

See the answer for "Will you eventually decommission your public cloud?".

#### Will you also build better migration capabilities for other public clouds, such as Azure?

Rackspace is excited about our
[Fanatical Support for Azure offering] (https://www.rackspace.com/en-us/microsoft/managed-azure-cloud)
and also about the growth that Azure is experiencing. Our assessment is that
AWS is the preferred destination for most of our customers who want to migrate
today, so our strategy is to begin with solutions in the area with the highest
demand.
